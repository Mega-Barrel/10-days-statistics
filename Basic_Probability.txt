Objective
	In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. 

'''

Task

	In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

	(a). 2/3			(b). 5/6 âœ”
	(c). 1/4			(d). 1/6

'''
Explanation

	(4,6) (6,4) (5,5) (6,5) (5,6) (6,6) is all possible combinations

	That's 6 out of the 36 total possibilities. 
	Therefore, the remaining 30/36 possibilities fulfill the less than or equal to 9 requirement. Simplifying by a factor of 6, that's 5/6 chance.
