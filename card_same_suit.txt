Task

    You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

    (a). 1/156       (c). 1/39
    (b). 12/39       (d). 12/51 âœ”


Explanation

    We have only 51 cards left since we took 1 card and there are 13 cards each so by taking 1 card, it will decrement by 1.
    So we are left with 12/51.
