Task
    
    A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. 
    
    If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?


    (a). 1/12       (b). 7/12
    (c). 1/6        (d). 2/3  âœ”
