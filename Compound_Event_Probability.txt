There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.


	Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
	Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
	Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

	(a). 10/63		(b). 2/7
	(c). 17/42 âœ”	(d). 31/126


Explanation

	urn X has 4/7 probability of red
	urn Y has 5/9 probability of red
	urn Z has 1/2 probability of red

	urn X has 3/7 probability of black
	urn Y has 4/9 probability of black
	urn Z has 1/2 probability of black


	P(A or B or C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C)

				   = P(red red black) + P(red black red) + P(black red red)

				   = P(4/7 * 5/9 * 1/2) + P(4/7 * 4/9 * 1/2) + P(3/7 * 5/9 * 1/2)

				   = 51/126

				   = 17/42
